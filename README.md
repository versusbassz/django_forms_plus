# Django-Forms-Plus (dfplus)

The extendable ReactJS powered frontend for Django Forms 
controled by forms.BaseForm native declarations with some additions.

Define your forms in python code as usually you do and get React powered forms UI
almost for free ;)

## Features
- how to define a form? like a regular `forms.BaseForm` with some additions
- how are forms submitted? via AJAX
- validation & errors 
- fieldsets (layouts)
- customization
  - Python: use regular Django's idiomatic patterns/approaches around `django.forms` with some additions
  - JS: React code was build with extensibility in mind
  - CSS: use regular CSS classes, add your own. No CSS-in-JS (it's a by design decision)
