# django_forms_plus (DFP)

The extendable ReactJS-powered rendering layer for Django Forms.

## The state of the project
**This package is in ALPHA state. DON'T USE ON PRODUCTION (or do it on your own risk).
The architecture and approaches can get changed significantly in next versions.**  
Also, there aren't so many supported fields and widgets for now
since it's just a proof of concept mostly.

## Docs
Will be available in next versions.
